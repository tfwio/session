status: in development  
*valid sessoins have been broken in the last few commits*


A session package intended to provide some foundation which may be cusomized and
implemented, perhaps useful in [github.com/gin-gonic/gin] middleware aside any other heuristic it can be wired to.

This package provides a secure logon session by utilizing a sqlite3 database via [GORM],
so easily conforms to other data-systems.

users: id name salt hash

sessions: id userid sessid created expires cli-key

login logout stat register *!unregister*

Filter URI in middleware

**LIMITATIONS**

Each of these limitations is a blessing in disguise üòÅ

- freshly brewed.
- [*todo/feature*] One session on one client (browser session / IP) is allowed per User once initial session is created.  (can easily be modified)  
  Will likely fix this soon.


**EXAMPLES**


example: **CLI executable**

Another example implementation can be found in the [crypt.cli/sess.go] CLI app.

The CLI app is generally useful for looking at and configuring or testing User
salt/hash settings, verifying a generated user-password, etc;
not intended for use with or as a companion to the web-app.

To compile:
```bash
go build ./examples/cli
```

Or use the build helper (bash) script `./do cli`

```bash
./do cli
```

The tool allows you to (1) `create` a user/password which includes generation of
a session for the user, (2) `validate` the user/password and (3) `list` all
sessions including the user owning the session.

Apparently if you attempt to create the same user twice, it will fail to generate the user however creates a new session.  
The cli tool was written just to test creation and validation of user passwords as well as [GORM].

For example, after you compile the CLI app...


**generate a user**

```bash
./cli create -u admin -p password
```
generates the following output
```text
{1 admin dW6tmIxySUoV9SJr5OJ9aYH1b35QzuqpSoxo1KmHVIw33FpdM6asZ+Q0uYEFZ2fb K0Bt+bF4qiTNYMkrJ3tF7RdxGBjuV0zsDpV4htJ2B+U=}

```
**verify user password**
```bash
./cli validate -u admin -p doomedtofail
```
outputs
```text
Result: false
```
Lets try the working "password"
```bash
./cli validate -u admin -p password
```
outputs the following success
```text
Result: true
```
Finally, we can call the following to show each user-session stored in the sessions table including the user name.
```bash
./cli list
```
